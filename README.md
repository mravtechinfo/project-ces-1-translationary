# project-ces-1-translationary
Translation is Important because people prefer their native Language. To effectively understand to people, it's not enough to speak a language that they understand (especially if their understanding is limited)


A large amount of concentration and expertise goes into making a translated text flow as smoothly as the original text, similar to authoring a piece of writing from scratch.
Our aim to solve this problem by making a website in which people can translate their sentences from any language to any other language and it will also word meaning .


Within a single website user can find meaning and   translate it to another language
